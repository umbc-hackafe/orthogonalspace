# Orthogonal.Space #

Orthogonal Space is a starship bridge simulator that runs in the browser.

## Development ##
To get started, you'll need Python 3.5, [crossbar](https://crossbar.io), and [ODE with python bindings](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ode-python-bindings/). After cloning the ropo, run `setup.py install` as root to put the data files in place (or copy them manually). To start the game, run `crossbar start` in the root of the repository.
